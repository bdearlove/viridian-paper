# Run time and RAM plots

Reproduce the supplementary figures of CPU time, Wall clock time, and
peak RAM by running the script `./male_plots.py`. It uses the supplementary
table `run_time_ram_suppl.tsv` to make the plots. The output PDF files
are included here: `cpu.pdf`, `wall_clock.pdf`, `ram.pdf`.
